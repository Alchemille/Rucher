This code describes a beekeeping management system for beekeepers. For now, it is only available in French.

The features it supports for each user are:

- Creation/Deletion/Update of apiaries and their visualisation on an interactive map
- Creation/Deletion/Update of hives in each apiary
- Creation/Deletion of events for apiaries or hives
- Filtering of events with multiple criteria, and sorting by date

Left to implement:

- Use geoiplookup to proxy center location of user.
- Provide a feature to reason about "supers": their numbers and weights.
- Check privacy/legal rules to comply with.
- Profile page (possiblity to change center)
- Monitoring of website.
